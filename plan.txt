To-do:
1. Interface - the page must contain header, filter tool, list of tasks, and tool for creating new tasks
2. Tasks are stored and displayed as a list of clickable objects (but they don't have to be objects)
3. When checkbox linked with task is clicked, status of the task is changed. This is seen as a graphic change, but it's a database change too.
4. Filter tool can switch between different sorting of task (Sort by: the latest, the oldest)
5. Display encouraging and appreciating message when the task is finished

log-in page, user functionality etc.

1. Login/Sign up page
2. Front-end validation (format of the input values)
3. Back-end validation (preventing attacks on database, password hashing etc.)
4. Individual task table for every user
5. Overall security
