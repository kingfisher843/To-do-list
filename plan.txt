To-do:
1. Interface - the page must contain header, filter tool, list of tasks, and tool for creating new tasks
2. Tasks are stored and displayed as a list of clickable objects (but they don't have to be objects)
3. When checkbox linked with task is clicked, status of the task is changed. This is seen as a graphic change, but it's a database change too.
4. Filter tool can switch between different sorting of task (Sort by: the latest, the oldest)
5. Display encouraging and appreciating message when the task is finished

Where should i put this? (that's what he said!)
1. tasks.blade.php in resources/views + route('/') in routes
2. + 3. Storing in the mysql database created in laravel, handled by todoController.php in app/Http/Controller
Displayed in the file from point 1.
